# Additional Challenges for Orca4

Here are some additional project ideas:

1. **Obstacle Avoidance System** (using orca_extend):
   Implement a node that detects obstacles in the AUV's path and modifies the trajectory to avoid collisions. Use simulated sonar or vision data for obstacle detection.

2. **Multi-AUV Coordination**:
   Extend the simulation to run multiple AUVs, implementing basic swarm behaviors or cooperative mission planning.

3. **Acoustic Communication Simulation**:
   Model underwater acoustic communication, including limitations like low bandwidth and high latency, affecting how the AUV communicates with a simulated surface vessel.

4. **Energy Management System** (using orca_extend):
   Create a node that models battery consumption and optimizes mission execution based on available energy.

5. **Fault Detection and Recovery**:
   Implement a system to detect simulated hardware faults or sensor failures, with appropriate recovery behaviors.

6. **Current and Disturbance Simulation**:
    Model ocean currents and other disturbances, requiring the AUV to actively compensate to maintain its trajectory.

7. **Machine Learning for Seafloor Classification** (using orca_extend):
    Implement a node that uses machine learning to classify different types of seafloor terrain based on simulated sensor data.

8. **Docking Simulation**:
    Create a simulated docking station and implement the logic for the AUV to autonomously dock for recharging or data offloading.

9. **Adaptive Mission Execution** (using orca_extend):
    Develop a node that adapts mission parameters based on encountered conditions, such as adjusting survey density in areas of interest.

10. **Underwater Image Enhancement**:
    Implement image processing techniques to enhance underwater imagery, simulating the challenges of underwater visual data collection.

Remember to leverage the orca_extend package when implementing Python-based nodes, and consider how your chosen project integrates with the existing Orca4 architecture.
